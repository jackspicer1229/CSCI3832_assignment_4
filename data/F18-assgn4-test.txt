1	BACKGROUND
2	:
3	Ischemic
4	heart
5	disease
6	is
7	the
8	primary
9	cause
10	of
11	morbidity
12	and
13	mortality
14	among
15	diabetics
16	,
17	especially
18	those
19	who
20	became
21	ill
22	at
23	a
24	young
25	age
26	.

1	More
2	importantly
3	,
4	this
5	fusion
6	converted
7	a
8	less
9	effective
10	vaccine
11	into
12	one
13	with
14	significant
15	potency
16	against
17	established
18	E7
19	-
20	expressing
21	metastatic
22	tumors
23	.

1	Reverse
2	transcription
3	-
4	PCR
5	analysis
6	of
7	mRNA
8	from
9	patients
10	shows
11	that
12	each
13	of
14	these
15	five
16	mutations
17	results
18	in
19	aberrant
20	splicing
21	.

1	Using
2	the
3	postural
4	and
5	force
6	data
7	as
8	input
9	to
10	a
11	3
12	-
13	D
14	biomechanical
15	model
16	,
17	the
18	lumbosacral
19	spinal
20	compression
21	was
22	calculated
23	.

1	Sequence
2	analysis
3	revealed
4	significant
5	differences
6	between
7	the
8	5
9	'
10	region
11	of
12	the
13	beta
14	subunit
15	gene
16	and
17	the
18	corresponding
19	regions
20	of
21	the
22	homologous
23	GlyR
24	alpha
25	subunit
26	genes
27	;
28	it
29	also
30	identified
31	a
32	novel
33	exon
34	(
35	exon
36	0
37	)
38	that
39	encodes
40	most
41	of
42	the
43	5
44	'-
45	untranslated
46	portion
47	of
48	the
49	GlyR
50	beta
51	mRNA
52	.

1	Therefore
2	,
3	we
4	suggested
5	that
6	both
7	proteins
8	might
9	belong
10	to
11	the
12	PLTP
13	family
14	.
