# Set-up Walkthrough:
To start, begin by having latest versions of NumPy and SciPy. Then, install scikit-learn:

```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
or with conda:
```
conda install scikit-learn
```

Then, install seqlearn, which is an extension for scikit-learn. The installation folder is already in this Github repo, so just run:

```
python setup.py install
```
